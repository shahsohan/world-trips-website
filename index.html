                    The choice of destination ultimately depends on your preferences and interests. If you seek cultural
                    richness and history, consider Bangladesh or Sri Lanka. For natural beauty and serenity, explore the

                    cosmopolitan
                    experiences. Indonesia provides an exotic blend of culture and nature, while the Maldives beckons
